# MACHINE LERNING FOR DRAWINGS CLASSIFICATION

The attached code includes three separate Python notebooks, each one of them containing a different model.
In order to be able to run the code, follow these steps:
1. Select one of the three notebooks.
  - [Convolutional Neural Network](code/cnn.ipynb)
  - [Support Vector Machine](code/svm.ipynb)
  - [TSNE: t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding](code/tsne.ipynb)
3. Open the selected notebook from Google Colaboratory (it could also be uploaded to Jupyter Notebook, but execution times would be longer because no GPUs could be used).
4. Once in Google Colaboratory, press command/control+F9 to execute all cells.
This process should run smoothly and bug-free, please contact gonzalocp6@gmail.com for any doubts.
